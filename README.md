Built by using:

1.	Clean Architecture -> It provide separation of concern & ease of  scalability, performance, security, code reduction etc.
2.	Hilt -> For Dependency Injection.
3.	MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] -> MVVM separate an application's business logic and UI. Loosely coupled, increasing the testability.
4.  Jetpack Compose -> Used latest declarative design pattern for designing views, this help to create complex UI easily
5.	LiveData -> It's an Observable data holder. Works on Observer Pattern and updates the view whenever there is change in data. Also, Activity lifecycle aware.
6.	Navigation -> We used Jetpack Navigation component. Provides a consistent way to manage the Activity/Fragment. Uses visual graph to make the entire process easier, clearer and more consistent.
7.	ViewModel -> It's a class that holds the state of UI. Encapsulate the business Logic and is Lifecycle aware.
8.	Unit testcases (JUnit, Mockito)
